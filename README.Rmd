`vjsim` is R package that simulates vertical jump with the aim of teaching basic biomechanical principles, FV profiling, and exploring assumptions of FV optimization models. 

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/mladenjovanovic/vjsim) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mladenjovanovic/vjsim")

require(vjsim)
```

## Usage

Please read accompanying vignettes for examples and usage of the `vjsim` package


### [Introduction](https://mladenjovanovic.github.io/vjsim/articles/introduction-vjsim.html)

This vignette discusses the basic mechanical representation of the vertical jump system. Please read this to understand the overall setup. Access it by clicking the above link or running the following code:

``` r
vignette("introduction-vjsim")
```

### [Simulation](https://mladenjovanovic.github.io/vjsim/articles/simulation-vjsim.html)

This vignette continues the [Introduction](https://mladenjovanovic.github.io/vjsim/articles/introduction-vjsim.html) vignette and expands on the topic of simulation and how vertical jump is simulated. Access it by clicking the above link or running the following code:

``` r
vignette("simulation-vjsim")
```

### [Profiling](https://mladenjovanovic.github.io/vjsim/articles/profiling-vjsim.html)

Once you understand how the [Simulation](https://mladenjovanovic.github.io/vjsim/articles/simulation-vjsim.html) works, we can start playing with profiling. Force-Velocity (FV), Load-Velocity (LV), and other profiles are discussed. Access it by clicking the above link or running the following code:

``` r
vignette("profiling-vjsim")
```

### [Optimization](https://mladenjovanovic.github.io/vjsim/articles/optimization-vjsim.html)

In this vignette I will introduce few optimization models, influenced by the work of Pierre Samozino and Jean-Benoit Morin. Access it by clicking the above link or running the following code:

``` r
vignette("optimization-vjsim")
```

### [Exploring](https://mladenjovanovic.github.io/vjsim/articles/exploring-vjsim.html)

In this vignette we are going to explore various assumptions of the model, "optimal" FV profiles and some other interesting questions. Access it by clicking the above link or running the following code:

``` r
vignette("exploring-vjsim")
```

### [Modeling](https://mladenjovanovic.github.io/vjsim/articles/modeling-vjsim.html)

In this vignette I am going to show you how you can use `vjsim` to create athlete profiles from collected data

``` r
vignette("modeling-vjsim")
```


## [Shiny App](https://athletess.shinyapps.io/shiny-simulator/)

To run the Shiny app, use the following code, or by clicking on the above link (this will take you to the *shinyapps.io*)
``` r
# install.packages(c("shiny", "plotly", "DT"))
run_simulator()
```
